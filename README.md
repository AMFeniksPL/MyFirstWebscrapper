# MyFirstWebscrapper
This is my first webscrapper in python. It can webscrap OLX offers of renting places in Krakow.
At this moment you can:
- launch webscrapper to check first 3 pages of Cracow rooms to rent in OLX.
- choose many websites that you found and launch them.

TODO:
- choose different categories things in OLX;
- choose different div class names in case of update of website;
- make filter for found data;
